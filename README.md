# üê∂ Dog Breed Classifier

This repository contains a web application built using **Streamlit** that classifies dog breeds from uploaded images. The model provides the **top 3 breed suggestions** with corresponding percentages of prediction accuracy. This project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **Stanford Dog Breed Dataset**.

## üîó Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the project here: [Dog Breed Classifier App](https://dog-breed-classification-by-caroline.streamlit.app/).

## Project Brief

The Dog Breed Classifier allows users to upload an image of a dog, which is then analyzed using a pre-trained CNN model. The application returns the top 3 dog breed predictions along with the confidence level for each breed. The model is trained on the Stanford Dog Breed Dataset, which contains over 20,000 images of 120 breeds. The web app is built using Streamlit for easy deployment and user interaction.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the **Stanford Dog Breed Dataset**, which can be accessed [here](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

This dataset is well-suited for image classification tasks and provides a diverse set of dog images for training robust models.
